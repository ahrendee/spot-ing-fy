# The Traveler
Assignment for ING Labs

This app lets you select 2 countries, then shows you the shortest path between those 2 countries and finally show you some ineresting data about a chosen country from that list.

The app is built with Ionic 5, Angular 9 and uses Apollo and GraphQL to retrieve the country data from an external source (https://countries-274616.ew.r.appspot.com/)

Unfortunately due to private circumstances the tests are not complete. The e2e suite succeeds but contains only a small portion of the tests it should; the unit tests unfortunately do not succeed.
